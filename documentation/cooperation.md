- Raphael: Adaptable, R&D, new features from frameworks
- Zoe: Quick study
- Megan:

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

- Dustin: Design effecient front end UI with intergration to API's and big picture with scaffolding and modularization
- Julian: I can write a large volume of code pretty quickly
- Raphael:  Doing research and development, problem solver.
- Zoe: I will pick up on things, and ensure we avoid conflicts.
- Megan: UMLs, wireframing, general support and RESEARCH QUEEN

- Julian: Better at TDD
- Raphael: Managing state, TDD, routing / navigation
- Zoe: I want to improve my confidence and competency. I want to improve on my technical strength as well.
- Megan:

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Daily review
- Hourly check-ins
- Using project week as a learning opportunity to try new API's, libraries, and services.
- Use project week to build relationships and stregnthen AGILE methodologies.
- Pair/solo programming on delegated features

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Have fun with it and operate from a growth mindset. Ensure we odo not take anything too seriously that could effect your team's relationships.
- Be open to constructive feedback and try and resolve all issues on the floor.
- If issues are not able to be resolved internally, escalate to instructor for guidance.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Suggest pair programming to get everyone involved if certain topics are outside of the realm of knowledge. The goal is to create a learning experience even if something may be outside of one's scope.
- Evaluate workloads during daily check-ins to ensure a balanced output of work.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Communicate during check-ins
- Be open about your needs and weaknesses and areas looking to improve.
- Be receptive to other's needs - we are diligent to ensure there is a sense of safety where there is no "dumb" questions.
- Mindfulness to see compassion in each members path and areas of strengths and weaknesses.

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Ask not, receive not. - Speak up all concerns should be able to be handled given the safe space.
- Offer support and encouragement to dive in.

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- If a conflict takes longer than 30 minutes to resolve among project members, resort to instructor involvment for guidance.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Dustin: Anytime
- Julian: Anytime
- Raphael: 9A.M. - 6P.M. (Available on Slack anytime)
- Zoe: 10A.M. - 10P.M. PST
- Megan: Class schedule

2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack
- Remo
- Zoom

3. How often will you take breaks?

- As needed
- General rule of thumb (5-10 minute each hour)

4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Focus on MVP and 80% test coverage
- Reevaluate necessity of features
- Get TA/Instructor help/direction

5. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- Slack (no pressure on the weekend)
- After hours communication is completely fine via Slack.

6. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- Morning check-ins to align and tackle the day's workload.
- Huddles before major merges.
- Huddles to ensure we are pulling down new features at the same time before re-branching back into other features.
- Huddles are an opportunity to voice concerns / strategies for implementation of ideas and features.

7. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- Validate perspectives
- Verify that you have group continuity at check-ins.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Huddles, delgating tasks based on group dynamics in terms of strenghts and weaknesses, time management and prioritized focus on functionality of main features first.

2. What project management tool will be used?

- Trello
-

## Git Process

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- Documentation
- Code
- Tests
- Front-end
- Back-end
- Cloud features
- API integrations & features

2. How will you share the repository with your teammates?

- Organization
- Main repo with restrictions on dev and main.

3. What is your Git flow?

- Work on indivdual dev branches
- Merge features to a test dev branch for the duration of the project
- Final version pushed to main branch for production

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow?

- Yes

5. How many people must review a PR?

- One other person than the person who commits (2 people)

6. Who merges PRs?

- Whoever opened the PR should merge after reviewed and double-checked for conflicts

7. How often will you merge?

- Per feature, with room for adjustments

8. How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

- Slack or live in Remo
